## Function stopped working several hours after a redeploy

### Cause

The new deploy failed, and the [fallback mechanism has been triggered](/serverless/functions/reference-content/functions-limitations/#versioning-and-rollback).

### Possible solution

Identify the element that caused the deployment to fail, fix the error, and deploy the function again.
