## Problem

I cannot create a Serverless Containers namespace.

### Cause

This issue can happen for the following reasons:

- You created too many namespaces and reached [your account's quota](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/additional-content/organization-quotas/#serverless-containers).

- You created too many Registry namespaces and reached [your account's quota](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/additional-content/organization-quotas/#container-registry).

### Possible solutions

Make sure that you did not exceed the maximum number of allowed namespaces with the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/) or with the [API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-containers/#path-namespaces-list-all-your-namespaces).
